 * binary_tree_is_heap - afunction that checks if a binary tree is a valid

 * Itâ€™s a complete tree.
 * In a Max Binary Heap, the value at root must be maximum among
 * all values present in Binary Heap.
 * The last property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree.
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the tree to check.
 *
 * Return: 1 if tree is a valid Max Binary Heap, 0 otherwise.
 *         If tree is NULL, return 0.
